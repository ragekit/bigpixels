BIG//PIXELS
======
A really small and simple (but life-saver) way to display a video on spanning multiple screen, like, on 2 videoprojector, on a mac.

(Mac osx doesn't allow to have several displays working in fullscreen).

How to make things work : 
----

1. Compile the sketch in processing (tested with Processing V2.0B8)
2. Open bigpixels.app, go in content and replace the info.plist with the one from this repo
3. Put config.xml in the same folder as bigpixels.app, change it to have the <size> tag matching your WHOLE screen areas, change the path of your video (relative to the .app)
4. The video will be displayed from the main screen top left corner, without the os or app menubar.
